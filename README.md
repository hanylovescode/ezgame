We are trying to build a game using Godot Engine. To practice programming and
teamwork.

### Github

- [X] Create a repo
- [ ] Allow multiple contributers
- [ ] Resolve code conflicts

### Game Assets

- [ ] Player (animated and multiple directions)
- [ ] Platform
- [ ] Traps/Obstacles
- [ ] Surrounding environment

### Godot

- [ ] Understand ECS
- [ ] Know how to implement it in Godot
- [ ] ... (will update later)
